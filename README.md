# Automatic-Railway-Gate-Control
The automatic railway gate control project is an important research endeavor that has the potential to significantly improve safety on railroads. The research project began by gathering information about railroad gate control devices, which were first used in 1849 and were developed primarily in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Initially, these devices were mechanical in nature, with an operator controlling the gate through the use of a lever. Later versions of the device included electric and mechanical components, as well as a mechanism that allowed operators to open and close the gate while inside a cab of the engine. Today, electronic gate control devices are commonly used in modern trains throughout the world. I created this sample code and implementation for an Arduino-based gate control system to demonstrate how this complex system could be controlled using a microcontroller. The device shown in the schematic diagram uses an 1/0 expander board to connect multiple inputs and outputs to the Arduino Uno, and it also incorporates an analog joystick input for controlling the position of the gate.<br>
